                    <p>Bruce Wayne was born to wealthy physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, who were
                        themselves members of the prestigious Wayne and Kane families of Gotham City, respectively.</p>

                    <p>When he was three, Bruce's mother Martha was expecting a second child to be named Thomas Wayne,
                        Jr. However, because of her intent to find a school for the underprivileged in Gotham, she was
                        targeted by the manipulative Court of Owls, who arranged for her to have a car accident. She and
                        Bruce survived, but the accident forced Martha into premature labor, and the baby was lost</p>

                    <p>While on vacation to forget about these events, the Wayne Family butler, Jarvis Pennyworth was
                        killed by one of the Court of Owls' Talons. A letter he'd written to his son Alfred, warning him
                        away from the beleaguered Wayne family, was never delivered. As such, Alfred - who had been an
                        actor at the Globe Theatre at the time[3] and a military medic before that, traveled to Gotham
                        City to take up his father's place, serving the Waynes as butler</p>

                    <p>As he grew older, his family's reputation made Bruce restless, and he began sneaking out of
                        school to visit Gotham City, where he wouldn't be so easily recognized.[5] On one such outing,
                        when he was ten years old, he was picked up by Officer Jim Gordon and his partner on their
                        patrol. En route back to the station, Bruce witnessed Jim accepting a trench coat as a bribe
                        from a tailor — though neither realized it was a bribe at the time — but Bruce would remember it
                        as an indicator of Jim's character</p>

                    <p>After his parents picked Bruce up at the police station, the Waynes went to see The Mark of Zorro
                        at the Monarch Theater. When the Waynes were walking home after the movie, a mugger named Joe
                        Chill attempted to rob them at gunpoint, and panicked. shooting both Thomas and Martha dead</p>
